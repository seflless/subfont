# Sub Font

Demo of taking a woff2 and a sub set of characters and creating a much smaller woff2 file, only capable of rendering the subset of characters.

# Usage

```
git clone
cd subfont
npm install
npm start
# A much smaller .woff2 file called "Shantell_Sans-Tldrawish-Subset.woff2" should now be saved
```
